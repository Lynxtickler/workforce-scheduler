The Linear Programming artifact created in my Bachelor's Thesis

## Notes
- The code version history in this repository starts from the point where my Bachelor's Thesis was finished.
- The codebase is rather janky. It will be improved and modularised whenever I find the time to clean it up.

## Prerequisites
Program is developed and tested with Python 3.8+ and PuLP 2.4+ but slightly earlier versions might work.

PuLP's PyPI-page: https://pypi.org/project/PuLP/

## Usage
Usage documentation will be added later.
